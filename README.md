# Home Price Prediction Project

Objective: Developed a predictive model to estimate home prices in the USA using macroeconomic variables.
Data Collection: Sourced 20 years of macroeconomic data from official U.S. government websites.
Data Analysis: Cleaned and explored data to ensure dataset integrity and relevance.
Model Development: Constructed an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, achieving an R-squared of 0.975 and an adjusted R-squared of 0.970.
Multicollinearity Management: Detected high multicollinearity and mitigated it by deploying a Random Forest model.
Performance Enhancement: Optimized model accuracy with Random Forest, realizing a 99.66% improvement over the baseline and delivering robust performance on both training and test datasets.
